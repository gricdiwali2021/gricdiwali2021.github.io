Hand crafted products are created by Renuka Self-Help-Group Rural women micro credit groups. Formed by [Jnana Prabodhini Stree Shakti Prabodhan](https://www.jnanaprabodhinifoundation.org/self-help-groups) Under the guidance of Jnana Prabodhini, Pune.

These diyas are hand crafted by the women under the program as an alternative means of lively hood, away from toxic cigarette making. You can follow more off their work at their Instagram handle at [@strishaktiprabodhan](https://www.instagram.com/strishaktiprabodhan/)
