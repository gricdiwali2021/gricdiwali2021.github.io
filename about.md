Hand crafted products are created by Renuka Self-Help-Group Rural team, empowering women through sustainable  micro credit groups. These groups are backed by [Jnana Prabodhini Stree Shakti Prabodhan](https://www.jnanaprabodhinifoundation.org/self-help-groups) under the guidance of Jnana Prabodhini, Pune.

Diwali diyas are hand crafted, packaged and pre-shipped to Glen Rock from Pune, Maharashtra under joint affiliation of [Jnana Prabodhini Stree Shakti Prabodhan](https://www.jnanaprabodhinifoundation.org/self-help-groups) & Jnana Prabodhini Foundation 100% of all suggested donations via volunteers reach [Jnana Prabodhini Stree Shakti Prabodhan](https://www.jnanaprabodhinifoundation.org/self-help-groups). In other words, all funds raised from this campaign will be collected to pay back the micro credit groups & women.
